# dotfiles

I've gone over a lot of iterations with regard to storing dotfiles. At one time I even wanted
to use ansible! Yeah, rabbit holes - I have this strange grativation towards them.

Anyway, this tiem we're super-pragmatic, right? We just want settings.
But hey, I work on multiple types of systems, so this needs to work on desktops
and servers.

And ofcourse on
- macos
- *buntu
- alpine
- centos
- rhel
- *BSD
- WSL2
- cygwin.

And so I ended up back with GNU Stow. And I added a little, pragmatic, twist.

And another one.<br>
And another one.<br>
And another one.<br>
And another one.<br>
Oh, I bet you know where this is going..<br><br>
